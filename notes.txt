Football is one of the most popular games in the world. In terms of popularity, it is as popular as cricket. Comparatively, it is more popular in Europe and Latin America. As the popularity grows in india, the desire to compete it is rising, but the skill to host and manage matches can't keep up. In this project, we decided to tackle that problem by utilizing the latest technologies to reduce the skill needed to manage the tournament.
